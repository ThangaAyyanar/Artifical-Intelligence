# Statistics

yes or no
predict / decision

statistics is about making sense of data and figuring out how to put that information to use

Statistics
 - study and practice of collecting and analyzing data. ( Field of statistics )
 - Facts or summarize of data.
 - Tools which help us to reason.
 - see through uncertainty.

## Ronald A Fisher
 - tells large portion of statistics

## Statics plural
 - Descriptive 
	- how spread the data are.
 - Inferential 
	- allow us to make conclusions that extend beyond the data we have in hand.
	- Test idea or hypothesis.
	- help us to conclude decision in uncertainty.

## Measure of central tendency
 - Mean or Average
	sum of data / number of data items
 - Median
	The middle number if we lined up our data from smallest to largest.
 - Mode
	The value that appears most in our data set.

## Distribution
	A distribution shows us how often each value occurs in our data set, which also known
	Distribution tell us about the shape and spread of data.

 - Normal
 	- A Distribution of data that has roughly the same amount of data on either side of the middle, 
          and has its most common values around the middle of the data.
	- Symmentric bell shaped graph
	- mean and median and mode are same
	- mean tells the centre of the distribution
	- standard deviation tells us whether the distribution is thin or broad. 
	- unimodal ( have one peak )
 - BiModal or multimodal distribution 
	- have two or more peaks
 - uniform distribution
	- same frequency

## Extra things about Distribution and Central tendency 
  - normal distribution has **Zero skew** since mean and median are same
  - when mean and median are different, a distribution is skewed ( unusaually extreme values on one side of our distribution )
    here mode will be highest point in distribution, median will stay in the middle, but the mean will pulled towards the unusual
  - **Mean lot higher than Median** -> value (or values) that are relatively large in our data set.
  - **Mean lot lower than Median** -> value (or values) that are relatively small in our data set.

## Measure of Spread
 - Range
	Range takes the largest number in dataset and subtract with smallest number in the set to give us the distance between 
	these two extremes.The larger the distance, the more spread out our data is.
 - InterQuartile Range(IQR) 
	The IQR looks at spread of the middle 50% of your data.
 - Variance
	
 - Standard deviation
	The average amount we expect a point to differ( or deviate) from the mean.
 - Variability

## Data Visualization
  Different types of data and (graph,charts) used for them
 - Categorical data
	- no meaning order
	described through frequency table
	relative frequency table ( above table information + particular frequency data/sum(frequency data) in % )
  	The charts and graph we used for categorical data are
		- Bar chart ( used for both single and multiple variable )
		- Pie chart ( used to visualize only single variable frequency )
		- pictograph ( frequency with pictures )
 - Quantitative data
	frequency table - construted through binning 
	Binnig = takes quantitative variable and bin it into categories that are either pre-existing or made up.
	
	The number that have order and consist spacing.
		- Histogram
		- Dot plot
		- Stem and leaf plot (stem relate to bins)
		- Box and whiskers plot	( it also has lower and upper fence )
		- Cumulative frequency plot

## Data Relationship
 - Correlation
	- Measures the way two variables move together, Both the direction and closeness of their movement.
	- we use standard deviations to scale our correlation so that it is always between -1 and 1,
	this is our correlation coefficient, r.
 - Squared correlation
	- r^2 is always between 0 and 1, and tell us - in decimal form - How much of the variance in one
	variable is predicted by other.

 - scatter plot 
	
## Simulation or Experiment
- Researcher uses random number to assign subjects to random groups.
- 
- Allocation bias 
- Selection bias
- placebo effect
- Controls => do nothing in an experiment
- matched pairs experiment
- repeated measures design

## Non-Experimental Method
- Survey 
	There are two things that can make or break a survey
		- The Questions
		- Who the reasearcher gives the questions to.
- Census 
	A census is a survey that samples an entire population.
